About Me
Hello! My name is William Lynch and I'm excited to connect with you on GitHub. As a Christian, husband, father, and brother, family and faith are the cornerstones of my life.
When I'm not coding, you can find me indulging in my passions: fishing and sports. Whether it's casting a line in the tranquil waters or cheering for my favorite teams, these activities bring joy and relaxation to my life.
Professionally, I am the proud owner of a Service-Disabled Veteran-Owned Small Business (SDVOSB), specializing in contracting. I find great fulfillment in providing quality services and supporting fellow veterans.
I have an insatiable curiosity that drives me to try new things and explore uncharted territories. Collaboration is key to my growth as an individual and a developer. I love working with people from diverse backgrounds, as their unique perspectives add depth and creativity to our projects.
Let's connect and create incredible things together!
Feel free to reach out to me on GitHub or through my email: [lewalter45@gmail.com]
